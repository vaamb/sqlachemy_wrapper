SQLAlchemy-wrapper
==================

A utility wrapper around SQLAlchemy. 

Adapted the recipes from
[flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/patterns/sqlalchemy/) and
[flask-sqlachemy](https://github.com/pallets-eco/flask-sqlalchemy/) to be
used outside Flask

Note
----

SQLAlchemy-wrapper is still in development and might not work properly.
